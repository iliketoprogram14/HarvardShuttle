# Harvard Shuttle #

## Summary ##

Harvard Shuttle was the only app/website that serves both real-time shuttle tracking information and shuttle schedules (to my knowledge, as of 4/11/2013). It's a Windows 8/RT application in which users can also save their most frequent "trips" as favorites and enjoy departure countdowns via live tile updates.

You can find the motivation for this project in [this long-winded post composed at 6 in the morning](http://iliketoprogram.com/2013/04/11/the-sad-state-of-shuttles-at-harvard).

Harvard Shuttle is a Windows Store app (ie, an app for Windows 8/RT) that enables users to easily find shuttle "trips" and a trip's corresponding schedule as well as real-time shuttle tracking of shuttles near your trip's origin. Users can "favorite" trips, which means they are easily accessible from the main screen of the app. Additionally, Harvard Shuttle's live tile updates automatically with a live countdown of the next shuttle departure of your most recently accessed trip! 

The app was originally released on 4/15/2013. I took down the app in the fall of 2014 since the shuttle schedule changed significantly again. As far as I know (as of 1/15/2015, at least), Shuttleboy no longer works, and the [official alternative provided by TransLoc](http://www.shuttle.harvard.edu/) is still user-unfriendly. You can still view the app in the store [here](http://bit.ly/11ugIYE). The 1 star review came after the shuttle schedule changed :)
